## 1. **Choosing right tool**

When choosing the right social media marketing (SMM) tools, it's important to focus on efficiency and minimizing errors. Here are some key rules to guide your decision-making process:

### **Rule #1 – Investigate the Tools Offered by the Platform**
- **Start with Platform-Specific Tools**: If you need a tool for a specific platform, first explore what the platform itself offers.
- **Stay Updated**: Ensure that the tools are up-to-date, as platforms frequently undergo changes, and outdated tools may not function properly.

### **Rule #2 – Think About What You Need to Accomplish**
- **Identify Your Needs**: Consider what tasks you need the tool to perform efficiently.
- **Focus on Pain Points**: Address persistent issues in your workflow, such as repurposing content across multiple platforms. 
- **Evaluate Reliability and Ease of Use**: Only a trial can determine if the tool is reliable and user-friendly.

### **Rule #3 – Ensure the Tool Supports Your Platforms**
- **Compatibility**: Make sure the tool is compatible with all the platforms you use in your campaigns.
- **Functionality**: Confirm that the tool can perform the necessary functions on each platform.

### **Rule #4 – Consider Team Usage and Roles**
- **Collaboration Needs**: Determine if the tool needs to support collaboration among team members and whether it can be used from multiple locations.
- **Technical Requirements**: Assess the level of technological expertise required by the tool.

### **Rule #5 – Consider Free vs. Paid Tools**
- **Start with Free Tools**: Many effective free tools are available for various SMM purposes. Begin with a free tool to learn the basics.
- **Evaluate Upgrading to Paid Tools**: As your needs grow, consider whether a paid tool might offer more advanced features necessary for your work.

### **Additional Advice**
- **Beginner Strategy**: Start by using tools for content creation, then move to tools for monitoring activity, and finally, tools for analyzing your social media growth and goal achievement.


## 1. Types of SMM Tools

The types of tools available to social media marketers, as illustrated in Figure 14.1, can be categorized into the following:

<p align="center">

### 1. **Single-Purpose Tools**

- **Definition**:
  - Tools developed to perform a specific marketing task, focusing on a single function within the broader scope of digital and social media marketing.

- **Example: Editorial Calendar**:
  - **Purpose**: Originally used by publishers to coordinate content creation tasks (e.g., writing, photography, graphic design) and ensure deadlines are met for publications.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29a719fa-2c91-4b0e-99a1-aab872a29e92"></p>




  - **Use in SMM**: 
    - Helps individual publishers and small teams manage multiple projects and media channels.
    - Ensures consistent scheduling of content across platforms (e.g., blog posts, social media updates).
    - Useful for coordinating tasks among multiple content creators or even a single user managing various social media activities.
  - **Features**:
    - Tracks progress from content creation to publication.
    - Organizes posts across platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and blogs.
    - Can evolve from simple to complex depending on the needs of the user or team.
    - Helps align content posting with key events, like product launches or holidays.

- **Significance**:
  - Even for individual content creators, an editorial calendar helps manage and optimize the timing and coordination of posts across different channels, ensuring that no content or platform is neglected.
  - As part of the content marketing toolkit, it highlights the importance of planning and strategy in social media efforts.

- **Broader Implications**:
  - While an editorial calendar is just one example, the concept underscores the value of finding tools tailored to specific tasks in SMM to improve efficiency and content coordination.
 
### 2. **Single Platform Tools**

- **Overview**:
  - Tools developed specifically for a single social media platform, such as Facebook, to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of marketing activities on that platform.

- **Facebook-Specific Tools**:
  - **Facebook Insights**:
    - Provides metrics directly from the brand page.
    - Allows businesses to track the popularity and engagement of their posts.
    - Integrated into Facebook, not a standalone tool.
  
  - **Mention**:
    - Tracks brand mentions across the web and social media.
    - Sends alerts when specific keywords or names are mentioned.
    - Connects to Facebook and other social media accounts for immediate response.
    - Offers both free and premium versions.
  
  - **NutshellMail**:
    - Monitors activity on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Yelp, FourSquare, and Citysearch.
    - Consolidates social media activity into an email summary for analysis and response.
    - A free tool provided by Constant Contact.

- **Facebook Targeting and Publishing Tools**:
  - **Interest Targeting**:
    - Allows marketers to target posts to specific audience segments based on their interests.
    - Enhances the precision of message targeting, reaching not only followers but also those who have engaged with similar content.
  
  - **Post End Date**:
    - Enables publishers to set an expiration date for posts in followers' news feeds while keeping the content available on the brand's page.
    - Helps maintain relevance in the content shown to users.
  
  - **Smart Publishing**:
    - Initially available to large publishers.
    - Identifies stories being shared by readers and broadens their reach without posting them on the publisher's page.
    - Includes a dashboard for monitoring content distribution.

- **Key Takeaways**:
  - **Diversity of Tools**: 
    - Facebook has generated a variety of tools, but not necessarily more than other platforms.
    - Marketers often use fewer automation tools for Facebook due to its central role in many social strategies.
  
  - **Learning Curve**:
    - Some tools offer straightforward functionality, making them easier to adopt.
    - Starting with simpler tools can ease the transition to more complex, multi-functional tools.

- **Importance of Single Platform Tools**:
  - Designed to maximize the effectiveness of marketing activities on specific platforms.
  - The availability of platform-specific tools highlights the complexity of choosing the right tool for a given task.


### 3. **Multiple Platform Tools**

Multiple platform tools are complex and few are free beyond a typical trial period. That makes the line between multiple platform tools and purchased services a little blurry. We will use as examples two that are accessible to an individual or to a small business. They are tools that are used by a person, not a suite of services that is executed by a supplier and reported to the client.

One such tool used by many of us is **Hootsuite**. Its basic functions are to:
- **Publish** on various platforms and to monitor activity there.
- **Schedule** their posts.
- **Create reports** for each of the platforms connected to their accounts.
- **Connect apps** in order to be able to access other platforms.
- **Monitor content** from selected blogs and websites.

There is more, including sharing between the entire SMM team, but these are the functions that are available, although limited in number of activities or platforms, to the Pro user of the platform. There is a free plan that allows the beginner to experiment with the tool.


<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f39df782-bb2f-488f-aeb1-f9fb194af36c"></p>

Zahay and Roberts both use Hootsuite to manage their social media efforts. The dashboard shown in **Figure 14.4a** demonstrates real-time social media feeds, personal posts, Google+ pages, and tools like Tailwind for scheduling and posting Pins. Tailwind provides analytics that track Pinterest activity over time and allows users to monitor conversions from Pinterest activity.


<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/672e559a-ebcf-4b06-85c1-c562c85ef698"></p>

**Figure 14.4b** illustrates how users can post to multiple platforms using Hootsuite. The message box shows options to select accounts, write messages, include links (which are automatically shortened), and schedule posts. Users can also include images and target specific groups with their messages.

Another approach to multiple platforms is the **SocialDraft social calendar**. It services Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram with a drag-and-drop scheduling calendar. It accommodates social media teams who create content in comma-separated values (CSV), a format that stores numbers and text in plain text format. Users can add images to their CSV file and upload them to the scheduling calendar.




<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b67fde2a-0ff0-410b-81bd-0e0140a9fa76"></p>


This tool includes features such as a link shortener (Bitly), social feed monitoring, alerts about selected topics, and identifying influencers. SocialDraft offers a free trial and several feature packages, though tools with this level of complexity rarely have free versions.




### 4. **Purchased Services**

The tools discussed so far require ongoing hands-on activity from the user. In contrast, purchased services are contracted out to third-party suppliers, functioning similarly to advertising agencies. These suppliers provide a set of services and advice on their use, often to brands or digital agencies who then offer these services to their clients. 

Purchased services platforms typically offer a broad range of social media marketing (SMM) services, aligned with the stages in the Social Media Planning Cycle. Due to the extensive services they offer and the fact that the supplier furnishes most of the personnel, these services are rarely free. They usually offer a free trial period to entice users into paid accounts, requiring a substantial investment of time from brand personnel.

**Sprout Social** is an example of a comprehensive tool available to social media marketers. **Figure 14.6** shows a main dashboard page for Twitter, specifically a Trends report. This tool allows users to select a date range and view important trends aggregated from Tweets on the brand’s profile. Trends include:

- Frequently mentioned topics
- Frequently mentioned hashtags
- Top topics and hashtags each day
- People and brands frequently mentioning the brand
- People and brands frequently mentioned in discussions of the brand


<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa092f8c-ce64-4e69-bc0a-54af237d3f53"></p>


Moving on to the **Twitter Profiles report**, **Figure 14.7** presents a monthly report for a hypothetical brand, "Sprout Coffee." This report provides data points such as:

- Number and growth of followers
- Engagement measures
- Demographics (gender and age)
- Mentions, retweets, and tweet types

**Figure 14.7: A Twitter Profiles Report**

These reports represent just a fraction of the features offered by comprehensive tools. Services like **Radian6**, acquired by Salesforce, integrate with the Salesforce Marketing Cloud. Radian6 specializes in monitoring and sentiment analysis, allowing brands to understand customer perceptions and manage relationships effectively.

**Figure 14.8** shows the summary dashboard for a brand using Radian6, highlighting:
<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae9d0e9a-f3fa-44bd-bc32-b9d57cbc02b2"></p>



- Volume of mentions
- Sentiment (positive or negative)
- Demographics of people talking about the brand
- Top influencers and trending topics


<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f2bb486-e643-4c3f-8e4a-9989da89cd31"></p>


**Figure 14.9** presents a similar dashboard, focusing on a specific topic "beachbodies" over a 7-day period. It provides detailed data on brand-related mentions, including the same metrics as the previous dashboard.


These figures illustrate the extensive features offered by purchased services, which include not only monitoring and reporting but also capabilities for publishing, messaging, and team collaboration.
